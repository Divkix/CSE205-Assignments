public class Assignment3 {
    // 1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public
    // interest.

    // Example: A software engineer knowingly develops a social media app that
    // exploits the privacy of civilians without their consent. This would violate
    // the first principle.

    // 2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER â€“ Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in
    // the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public
    // interest.

    // Example: A software engineer is working on a project for a client. The
    // software engineer is asked to add a feature that would allow the client to
    // track the location of their users. The software engineer knows that this
    // would violate the privacy of the users. The software engineer refuses to
    // add the feature. This would violate the second principle.

    // 3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related
    // modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

    // Example: A software engineer is working on a project for a client. The
    // project has a deadline in 2 weeks. The software engineer knows that the
    // project will not be completed in time and thus decides to remove some
    // features from the project to meet the deadline. This would violate the
    // third principle.

    // 4. JUDGEMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence
    // in their professional judgment.

    // Example: A software engineer has been employed with expertise in front-end
    // development, he/she decides to also make changes to parts of
    // code not under their authorization . This would violate the fourth principle.

    // 8. SELF - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding
    // the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the
    // practice of the profession.

    // Example: A software engineer codes for the algorithm of a social media site
    // to showcase videos of people from left wing in order to make them support
    // the left wing side of government as it alings with his political beliefs.
    // This would violate the eighth principle.
